# Description
This is my personal collection of Latex projects

# Build instructions
## Windows
You could try any of the following:
	- running pdflatex manually
	- copying to overleaf
	- installing WSL
## Linux
	- Most directions contain a bash script build.sh and a script vim.sh that executes build.sh, I have it setup to execute on a vim macro.
